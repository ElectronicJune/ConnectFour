# Connect Four AI

This is an AI for the game Connect Four. It uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make its moves.

## How to Play

* Enter the position (1-7) where you want to drop your piece. The AI will then make its move. 
* Pieces are represented by X and O, with you playing as O. 
* The first player will alternate between games.

## Connect Four Rules

Connect Four is a two-player game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. The first player to get four of their discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

## Minimax Algorithm

The minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in game theory and artificial intelligence. It is used to determine the best move for a player by considering possible future game states and choosing the move that results in the best outcome for the player.

## Alpha-Beta Pruning

Alpha-beta pruning is an optimization technique used in conjunction with the minimax algorithm. It reduces the number of nodes that need to be evaluated by the minimax algorithm by eliminating branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision.
